## **Introduction**

In this project I delve into the world of data science jobs and their associated skills and salaries. This project is a practical guide for data professionals and a glimpse into the skills needed for higher-paying roles.

## **Key Questions**

1. **Do More Skills Mean Better Pay?**
2. **What Are Salaries Like in Different Regions?**
3. **What Are the Top Skills for Data Professionals?**
4. **Whatâ€™s the Pay for the Top 10 Skills?**

## **Excel Skills Used**

- **Power Query:** For data extraction and transformation.
- **Pivot Tables & DAX:** For data analysis.
- **Power Pivot:** For advanced data modeling.
- **Advanced Charts:** For visualizing insights.

## **Data Analysis**

### 1. **Skills and Salary Correlation**

Using Power Query, I extracted and transformed data to explore the relationship between skills and salaries. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between the number of skills requested and median salary, particularly in roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist.

**Insight:** Acquiring multiple relevant skills can significantly boost earning potential. See the data transformation process in:
